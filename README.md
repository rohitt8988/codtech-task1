# 🛡️ File Integrity Checker

A simple yet powerful Python-based tool to check the integrity of files using hash verification. This project was developed as part of the **CodTech Internship** by **Rohit Patel**.

## 📌 About the Project

File integrity is crucial to ensure that files haven't been tampered with or corrupted. This tool calculates and compares cryptographic hashes (such as SHA256, MD5, etc.) of files to verify their integrity.

This Python script allows you to:
- Generate hash values of files
- Compare hashes to detect changes or corruption
- Support multiple hashing algorithms

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Supports multiple hashing algorithms (SHA256, SHA1, MD5)
- 📁 Check individual files or entire directories
- 🧾 Save and load hash reports for future comparisons
- 🛠️ Easy to use and modify for custom needs
